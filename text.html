        Lesson: Upholding righteousness is paramount, even in challenging situations.
        The Mahabharata repeatedly emphasizes the importance of dharma. Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, is a shining example of adhering to dharma,
        even at great personal cost. When in doubt, individuals are advised to align their actions with righteousness. As Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita, "When dharma declines,
        I manifest to protect the good and destroy evil."
